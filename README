Haven't you always wanted to get your weather data from Environment
Canada, instead of some of the other options out there?  Well, now
you can!

To build:

mvn clean package

Note that this is just a library, not an application.  We use OneJar
plugin so the resulting jar (find it in target/ directory) includes
all dependencies.

Suggested entry point:

WeatherHelper weatherSource = WeatherHelperFactory.getWeatherHelper();

From this class, you can get a list of Place objects representing the
possible unique locations to get weather from.  You can pass one of
these Place objects back in to get the WeatherData for that Place.
You can also ask for the WeatherData for the closest Place given a
pair of coordinates.

Example:

        WeatherHelper weatherSource = WeatherHelperFactory.getWeatherHelper();
        List<Place> places = weatherSource.getPlaces();
        for (Place place : places) {
            System.out.println(place.getName());
            WeatherData weather = weatherSource.getWeather(place);
            System.out.println("Current Temp: " + weather.getCurrentTemp());
            System.out.println("Current Conditions: " + weather.getCurrentConditions());
            System.out.println("High: " + weather.getTodayHigh());
            System.out.println("Low: " + weather.getTodayLow());
            System.out.println("Upcoming Conditions: " + weather.getUpcomingConditions());
        }

Note that the above program will take quite a while to run, and use a
nontrivial amount of data.
